description: Record the dependency relationships and operational results of nodes in the system

`Graph` is dagrs's main body. '`Graph` is a network that satisfies FBP logic, provides node dependencies, and runs all of its nodes completely asynchronously.



## Graph's structure

```rust showLineNumbers 
pub struct Graph {
    /// Define the Net struct that holds all nodes
    pub(crate) nodes: HashMap<NodeId, Arc<Mutex<dyn Node>>>,
    /// Store a task's running result.Execution results will be read
    /// and written asynchronously by several threads.
    pub(crate) execute_states: HashMap<NodeId, Arc<ExecState>>,
    /// Count all the nodes
    pub(crate) node_count: usize,
    /// Global environment variables for this Net job.
    /// It should be set before the Net job runs.
    pub(crate) env: Arc<EnvVar>,
    /// Mark whether the net task can continue to execute.
    /// When an error occurs during the execution of any task, This flag will still be set to true
    pub(crate) is_active: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    /// Node's in_degree, used for check loop
    pub(crate) in_degree: HashMap<NodeId, usize>,
    /// Stores the blocks of nodes divided by conditional nodes.
    /// Each block is a HashSet of NodeIds that represents a group of nodes that will be executed together.
    pub(crate) blocks: Vec<HashSet<NodeId>>,
    /// Abstract representation of the graph structure, used for cycle detection
    pub(crate) abstract_graph: AbstractGraph,
}
```

The above fields provide information such as the storage of node operation results, node information contained in the graph, and graph operation status.

## Create a Graph

A `Graph` contains multiple nodes, which can be added as long as they implement the [`Node`] trait.

### add node

Firstly, it is necessary to initialize a node that implements the `Node`trait. Let's use `DefaultNode` as an example.

```rust showLineNumbers {4}
use dagrs::NodeTable;
let mut node_table = NodeTable::new();
let node_name = "Node X";
let node = DefaultNode::new(NodeName::from(node_name), &mut node_table);
let node1_name = "Node Y";
let node1 = DefaultNode::with_action(
            NodeName::from(node1_name),
            HelloAction::new(),
            &mut node_table,
);
```

After calling the new function to create a default `Graph`, it is necessary to add nodes to the `Graph`, `Graph`provides the **add_node** function to add any node that implements the `Node` trait.

```rust showLineNumbers {4}
let mut graph = Graph::new();
graph.add_node(node);
```

### add edge between nodes

Once the nodes are added to the `Graph`, it is necessary to establish relationships between them by adding edges. The `Graph` provides the **add_edge** function to define a directed edge between two nodes, where the source node is connected to one or more target nodes.

For example, after initializing and adding two nodes (`node` and `node1`) to the `Graph`, you can establish an edge from `node` to `node1` as follows:

```rust showLineNumbers {4}
let node_id = node.id();
let node1_id = node1.id();
graph.add_edge(node_id, vec![node1_id]);
```

Here, `node.id()` and `node1.id()` retrieve the unique identifiers of the nodes `node` and `node1`, respectively. The `add_edge` function is called with the `node_id` as the source node and a vector containing `node1_id` as the target node(s). This creates a directed edge from `node` to `node1`.

If you need to connect a node to multiple target nodes, you can include all target node IDs in the vector, like this:

```rust showLineNumbers {4}
let target_nodes = vec![node1_id, node2_id, node3_id];
graph.add_edge(node_id, target_nodes);
```

This flexibility allows you to construct complex directed graphs by defining edges between various nodes.

## Execute a Graph and Retrieve Execution Results

After adding nodes and edges to the `Graph`, it is ready to be executed. The `Graph` provides the **start** function to begin the execution process, ensuring that all nodes are processed in the correct order based on their dependencies. Once execution is complete, you can retrieve the results produced by individual nodes.

For example, to start a `Graph` and obtain the execution result of a specific node (`node1`), you can perform the following steps:

```rust showLineNumbers {4}
graph.start();
let out = graph.execute_states[&node1_id].get_output().unwrap();
let out: &String = out.get().unwrap();
assert_eq!(out, "Hello world");
```

1. **Start the Graph**: The `start` function begins the execution of the `Graph`, processing all nodes in a manner that respects their dependencies and actions.
2. **Access Execution State**: After execution, the `execute_states` field of the `Graph` contains the state of each node. The state for a specific node can be accessed using its unique identifier (`node1_id` in this case).
3. **Retrieve the Node Output**:
   - Call `get_output()` on the node's execution state to obtain its output, which is wrapped in an `Option`.
   - Use `unwrap()` to extract the actual output value if it exists.
4. **Validate the Output**: In this example, the output is expected to be of type `String`, so it is further extracted using `get()`. The result can then be validated with assertions, such as checking if the output equals `"Hello world"`.

This process ensures that the `Graph` is executed properly, and the output of individual nodes can be reliably retrieved and verified.
