title: Send & Recv without id
description: Send or receive packets without caring about the receiver or sender.
---

In cases where you want to send or receive packets without caring about the sender or receiver, 
using `send_to` and `recv_from` is not a good idea. Therefore, we provide new methods for `InChannels` 
and `OutChannels` to handle this situation.

## Receive packets without sender's id

```rust
impl InChannels {
    pub async fn recv_any(&mut self) -> Result<(NodeId, Content), RecvErr> {
        let mut futures = Vec::new();
        let ids: Vec<NodeId> = self.keys();

        for id in ids {
            let channel = self.get(&id).ok_or(RecvErr::NoSuchChannel)?;
            let fut = Box::pin(async move {
                let content = channel.lock().await.recv().await?;
                Ok::<_, RecvErr>((id, content))
            });
            futures.push(fut);
        }

        if futures.is_empty() {
            return Err(RecvErr::NoSuchChannel);
        }

        match select_ok(futures).await {
            Ok((result, _)) => Ok(result),
            Err(_) => Err(RecvErr::Closed),
        }
    }

    // other methods ...
}
```

`recv_any` receives data from any available channel and returns both the sender's ID and the content.
This method will wait until any channel has data available.


## Send packets without receiver's id

```rust
impl OutChannels {
    pub async fn broadcast(&self, content: Content) -> Vec<Result<(), SendErr>> {
        let futures = self
            .0
            .iter()
            .map(|(_, c)| async { c.lock().await.send(content.clone()).await });

        join_all(futures).await
    }

    // other methods ...
}

```
Here we can use `broadcast` to send a packet to all the receivers.

Or we can call "get_receiver_ids" to get all available receiver node IDs and select one or some of them to send packets.

```rust
impl OutChannels {
    /// Returns a list of all available receiver node IDs.
    pub fn get_receiver_ids(&self) -> Vec<NodeId> {
        self.0.keys().copied().collect()
    }

    // other methods ...
}
```

Use cases of the above methods can be found in [example - receive any & broadcast & typed-action](../../../../examples/receive-any-typed-action).
