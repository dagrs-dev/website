title: Loop Subgraph
description: Looped nodes in Graph.
---

LoopSubgraph is a special node type designed to represent a subgraph of nodes that are executed 
in a loop structure within a larger computational graph. Instead of being executed directly, 
a LoopSubgraph acts as a container for a set of inner nodes, which are managed and executed repeatedly 
by the parent graph according to the loop logic.

The LoopSubgraph is included in the main graph as a single node, but internally contains
multiple nodes that will be executed repeatedly. The connection and execution of the loop is controlled
by the parent graph rather than the LoopSubgraph itself.

```rust showLineNumbers {}
pub struct LoopSubgraph {
    id: NodeId,
    name: NodeName,
    in_channels: InChannels,
    out_channels: OutChannels,
    // Inner nodes, contains the nodes that need to be executed in a loop
    inner_nodes: Vec<Arc<Mutex<dyn Node>>>,
}
```

`LoopSubgraph` is implemented by `Node` trait, so `Graph` will treat `LoopSubgraph` as a single node.
Users need to add nodes that need to form a loop structure to LoopSubgraph, and then add it to `Graph`.

Use cases of the `LoopSubgraph` can be found in [example - loop subgraph](../../../../examples/loop-subgraph).
