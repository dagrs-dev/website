title: Conditional Execution
description: Execute nodes in specific cases.
---

`ConditionalNode` is a specialized node type used in the Dagrs framework to control the execution flow based on custom conditions.
It encapsulates a user-defined condition, represented by the `Condition` trait, which determines whether the workflow should proceed 
or halt at this node.

It can evaluate the condition using input channels, output channels and environment variables.
When the condition is met during execution, Dagrs will continue running. If the condition is not met, Dagrs will stop on this node.

```rust showLineNumbers {}
pub struct ConditionalNode {
    id: NodeId,
    name: NodeName,
    condition: Box<dyn Condition>,
    in_channels: InChannels,
    out_channels: OutChannels,
}

impl ConditionalNode {
    /// Creates a new [`ConditionalNode`] with the given name and condition.
    /// The [`Condition`] determines whether execution should continue or stop at this node.
    /// The [`NodeTable`] is used to allocate a unique ID for this node.
    pub fn with_condition(
        name: NodeName,
        condition: impl Condition + 'static,
        node_table: &mut NodeTable,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            id: node_table.alloc_id_for(&name),
            name,
            condition: Box::new(condition),
            in_channels: InChannels::default(),
            out_channels: OutChannels::default(),
        }
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl Node for ConditionalNode {
    /// Returns the unique identifier of this conditional node
    fn id(&self) -> NodeId {
        self.id
    }

    /// Returns the name of this conditional node
    fn name(&self) -> NodeName {
        self.name.clone()
    }

    /// Returns a mutable reference to the input channels of this node
    fn input_channels(&mut self) -> &mut InChannels {
        &mut self.in_channels
    }

    /// Returns a mutable reference to the output channels of this node
    fn output_channels(&mut self) -> &mut OutChannels {
        &mut self.out_channels
    }

    /// Executes the condition logic of this node
    async fn run(&mut self, env: Arc<EnvVar>) -> Output {
        Output::ConditionResult(
            self.condition
                .run(&mut self.in_channels, &self.out_channels, env)
                .await,
        )
    }

    /// Returns true since this is a conditional node
    fn is_condition(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

Use cases of the `ConditionalNode` can be found in [example - conditional execution](../../../../examples/conditional-execution).
