title: State Subscription
description: Real-time monitoring of graph execution events.
---

Dagrs provides a state subscription mechanism that allows you to listen to events emitted during the graph execution. This is useful for building monitoring dashboards or logging systems.

## GraphEvent

The `GraphEvent` enum covers various lifecycle events:

- `NodeStart`
- `NodeSuccess`
- `NodeFailed`
- `NodeSkipped`
- `GraphStarted`
- `GraphFinished`
- `BranchSelected`

## Subscribing

You can obtain a receiver channel from the graph to listen for events.

```rust
let mut graph = Graph::new();
// ... setup graph ...

let mut receiver = graph.subscribe();

tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Ok(event) = receiver.recv().await {
        println!("Received event: {:?}", event);
    }
});

graph.start().unwrap();
```

Use cases of the State Subscription can be found in [example - State Subscription](../../../../examples/state-subscription).
